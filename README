Using a python script that calculates one estimation, we repeat X times
using swift-lang parallel scripting.

mcpi.py - actually calculates pi using monte carlo estimation, with given number of throws as a command line arg
mcpi.sh - invokes mcpi.py using shell script, with command line arg
mcpi.swift - should run mcpi.sh 10 different times, generating 10 output files, then use stats.sh to average those
swift.conf - configure swift settings
